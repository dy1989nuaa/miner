Linuxer's do not use GUI. :)

This is a CLI based miner game implemented with lib `ncursers`.

Before start the game, you decide the scale(SMALL, MEDIATE, and LARGE).

You move the cursor with h(left), j(down), k(up), and l(right) or arrow keys.
(Familiar? Yep, the author is also a VIMer).

Also use d(dig), m(mark) and f(flag) to play the game.


The whole rule will be included from wikipedia


Happy playing!
